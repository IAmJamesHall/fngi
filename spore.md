# Spore


## Spore Assembly
Spore has a 16bit bytecode and a very primitive assembler, from which it
bootstraps itself into a more "full featured" stack based language.

A single 16bit spore instruction can perform multiple orthoginal operations:
- immediate load, memory fetch, memory store, etc
- logical operation (add, subtract, eq, etc)
- jump, jump table, call or return


TODO: explain spore more.
